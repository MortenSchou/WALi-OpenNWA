WALi/OpenNWA 4.0:
  General features
  - Added 'scons CXX=...' to choose compiler and strong_warnings=0 to disable
    extra warning flags

  General bug fixes
  - Fixed building with broader range of compilers

  WALi features:
  - Added postorder visit functions to the witness visitor
  - Significant API changes to the BinRel domain, and addition of a feature
    to output diagrams

    calling WFA::print_dot to output extra attributes for either nodes
    or edges.

  WALi bug fixes:

    this can run almost an order of magnitude faster.

 - This is where records basically peter out without looking into the
   Subversion logs.
