WALi/OpenNWA 4.0:
  General features
  - Added 'scons CXX=...' to choose compiler and strong_warnings=0 to disable
    extra warning flags

  General bug fixes
  - Fixed building with broader range of compilers

  WALi features:
  - Added postorder visit functions to the witness visitor
  - Significant API changes to the BinRel domain, and addition of a feature
    to output diagrams
  - Added a new callback class, DotAttributePrinter, which allows someone
    calling WFA::print_dot to output extra attributes for either nodes
    or edges.

  WALi bug fixes:
  - Fixed a rather bad efficiency problem with path_summary; on large examples
    this can run almost an order of magnitude faster.
  - Made the Witness class cache zero and one values instead of creating a
    new object each time zero()/one() is called. In almost all cases this
    will result in a nice improvement in the amount of memory (and also
    speed) used. However, it can be a regression if the weights the witnesses
    are wrapping don't cache their own zeros and ones, or if many many many
    different kinds of weights are used. Let us know if this is a problem for
    you. (Or, modify the one() and zero() functions in Witness.cpp.)

  OpenNWA bug fixes:
  - Updated license and author information



WALi/OpenNWA 4.0 RC1:

 - This is where records basically peter out without looking into the
   Subversion logs.
